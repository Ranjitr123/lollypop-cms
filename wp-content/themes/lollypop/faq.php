                              <p>The field of UX Research helps to unearth the conscious and subconscious behavior of people that make them like/ dislike a product. Hence, in order to understand the myriad experiences, emotions, thoughts, behavior, motivations, reactions, actions, and attitudes that are displayed by the target audience when using a digital service/ product, we need researchers in the team. These people are expert in decoding human behavior and help lay a foundation for digital design or human-centered design.

                              <h3 class="faq fnt-28 fnt-800 d-inline-block">What is UX Design?</h3>
                              <p>UX design, in the most basic sense, is the process that helps determine the usability, as well as subsequent desirability, of a product; by taking into account all aspects of the user’s psychological journey with it. UX design entirely revolves around creating a detailed framework for the product by prioritizing on user needs.</p>
                              <p>UX design is a vital component in building the image of a given product--mobile app, website, etc vis-a-vis the response of the user; that is drawn from the functional utility, aesthetic appeal, and overall efficiency of that product.

                              <p>The process of designing any great product--app, website, or other--mainly incorporates the aspects of functionality and aesthetic quality. As has already been established, UX design makes up the functional aspects of a given product. The equally essential visual and interactive elements are covered by UI (User Interface) Design. Put simply, UI makes up the personality and voice of the product; and by extension, it's brand.

The PSD file helps developers to understand the design guidelines and elements such as the font, color palette, spacing, layout, and structure well. They can group similar elements to create the development framework and code.</p>

                              <p>Lollypop will create clickable prototypes in the Marvel app or Invision app post completion of the UI designs. These prototypes can be used for presentations, product walkthroughs and contains the UI assets for developers to use as the input and guide for conversion of designs into Front End code.</p>

                              <p>User Experience is a nascent field. We would suggest looking at the work experience over age. Lollypop has a combined experience of over 25 plus years in the field of design and all our designers come with a good command over visual tools. There is a design lead assigned to each project who drives innovation and ensures that new quality benchmarks are created consistently.</p>

                              <p>The time for designing a website/ app will directly depend on the scope of the project. We have had instances where we had put multiple people on a single project to complete the project fast but this would spike up the costs.</p>

                              <p>The cost of the project is directly proportional to the scope of the project. However, the basic engagement costs with Lollypop can range anywhere between USD 30 - USD 75 per hour depending on the complexity, scope, terms of engagement, and various other factors.</p>

                              <p>We generally follow multiple pricing models to accommodate the different needs of our clients:</p>
                           <p><b>Retainer Model:</b> This model is adopted where the scope of the project is ambiguous and we are exploring research and innovation. We take on the role of design consultants and help brands discover the hidden potentials and possibilities with their users. The minimum engagement period starts from 3 months and can extend as per the project requirement.</p>
                           <p><b>Fixed Bid Model:</b> It is recommended only for the projects where we are extremely clear about the scope of the project and needs little or no innovation. Here based on the scope of the project, we commit to the timelines and thereby costs are calculated.</p>
